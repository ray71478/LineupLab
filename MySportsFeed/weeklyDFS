Parameter	Description
{season}	
a value obtained by concatenating

(season start year) + "-" +
(season end year) + "-" +
either "regular" or "playoff", depending on the season's type

Note: if the starting and ending years are the same, you can just specify the single year.

You can also use the special keywords current, latest or upcoming.

Using current relates to the current in-progress season (whether regular or playoff). If a current season is not in progress (offseason), you'll receive an empty response with response code 400. Using latest will return the latest season (whether regular or playoff).

Note that current and latest will in fact apply to the same season if a season is in progress.

Using upcoming will only apply to a season which has been added, but has not yet actually started. This applies in cases where the upcoming season's game schedule is available, but there is no curent season underway (offseason, or between regular and playoff seasons). If no applicable season is available, an empty 400 response is returned.

2016-2017-regular

These samples demonstrate how to make a PULL request for this feed in various languages. Includes authentication via HTTP BASIC with your API Key credentials, and specifying compression where necessary.

You'll just need to replace the parameters for {pull-url} and {apikey_token} with appropriate values.

Or if you want an even more concrete example, check out our wrapper libraries on Github. If your favourite language isn't available as a wrapper library yet, it may soon be - let us know!


cURL
PHP
Python
Javascript
Node.js
Java
C#
Obj-C
Ruby
cURL's "-u" option allows you to specify the apikey_token and password directly, and creates the HTTP Authorization header for you transparently.
curl -X "GET" {pull-url}
	-u {apikey_token}:MYSPORTSFEEDS
	--compress
