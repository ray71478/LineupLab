These samples demonstrate how to make a PULL request for this feed in various languages. Includes authentication via HTTP BASIC with your API Key credentials, and specifying compression where necessary.

You'll just need to replace the parameters for {pull-url} and {apikey_token} with appropriate values.

Or if you want an even more concrete example, check out our wrapper libraries on Github. If your favourite language isn't available as a wrapper library yet, it may soon be - let us know!


cURL
PHP
Python
Javascript
Node.js
Java
C#
Obj-C
Ruby
cURL's "-u" option allows you to specify the apikey_token and password directly, and creates the HTTP Authorization header for you transparently.
curl -X "GET" {pull-url}
	-u {apikey_token}:MYSPORTSFEEDS
	--compress
