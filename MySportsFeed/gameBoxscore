Issue a HTTPS GET request to:

with optional parameters:

teamstats={list-of-team-stats} (filter team stats)
playerstats={list-of-player-stats} (filter player stats)
sort={sort-specifier} (sort the feed's content)
offset={offset-specifier} (filter results starting at the given offset)
limit={limit-specifier} (limit the maximum # of results)
force={force-if-not-modified} (force content)

where:

Parameter	Description
{season}	
a value obtained by concatenating

(season start year) + "-" +
(season end year) + "-" +
either "regular" or "playoff", depending on the season's type

Note: if the starting and ending years are the same, you can just specify the single year.

You can also use the special keywords current, latest or upcoming.

Using current relates to the current in-progress season (whether regular or playoff). If a current season is not in progress (offseason), you'll receive an empty response with response code 400. Using latest will return the latest season (whether regular or playoff).

Note that current and latest will in fact apply to the same season if a season is in progress.

Using upcoming will only apply to a season which has been added, but has not yet actually started. This applies in cases where the upcoming season's game schedule is available, but there is no curent season underway (offseason, or between regular and playoff seasons). If no applicable season is available, an empty 400 response is returned.

Valid examples are:

2016-2017-regular
2016-playoff
current
latest
upcoming
{game}	
Must represent a valid game. Specify this value by concatenating

(game date as YYYYMMDD) + "-" +
(away team abbreviation) + "-" +
(home team abbreviation)

Optionally, in cases where multiple games are scheduled on the same day between the same teams (MLB double-headers in particular), you will also need to specify the index of the game based on start time. This is only required if there are multiple applicable games between the teams on the same day.

(game date as YYYYMMDD) + "-" +
(away team abbreviation) + "-" +
(home team abbreviation) + "-" (game index)

You can also use the numerical ID, which can be obtained from any of the other game-related feeds.

Note: If you specify a non-existent game, or an exact match cannot be otherwise found, then a 404 response code will be returned. Valid examples are:

20161221-BAL-DET
20161221-BAL-DET-1
20161221-BAL-DET-2
