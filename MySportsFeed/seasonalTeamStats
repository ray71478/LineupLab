Issue a HTTPS GET request to:

https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/{season}/team_stats_totals.{format}
with optional parameters:

team={list-of-teams} (filter teams)
date={date-range} (filter on dates)
stats={list-of-stats} (filter stats)
sort={sort-specifier} (sort the feed's content)
offset={offset-specifier} (filter results starting at the given offset)
limit={limit-specifier} (limit the maximum # of results)
force={force-if-not-modified} (force content)

where:

Parameter	Description
{season}	
a value obtained by concatenating

(season start year) + "-" +
(season end year) + "-" +
either "regular" or "playoff", depending on the season's type

Note: if the starting and ending years are the same, you can just specify the single year.

You can also use the special keywords current, latest or upcoming.

Using current relates to the current in-progress season (whether regular or playoff). If a current season is not in progress (offseason), you'll receive an empty response with response code 400. Using latest will return the latest season (whether regular or playoff).

Note that current and latest will in fact apply to the same season if a season is in progress.

Using upcoming will only apply to a season which has been added, but has not yet actually started. This applies in cases where the upcoming season's game schedule is available, but there is no curent season underway (offseason, or between regular and playoff seasons). If no applicable season is available, an empty 400 response is returned.

Valid examples are:

2016-2017-regular
2016-playoff
current
latest
upcoming

Defaults to "true", which will always return the most up-to-date content based on your subscription level.

Specifying "false" will also avoid any throttling restrictions on your requests. See the Throttling section for more.

Properties
Name	Details
lastUpdatedOn	
Indicates the time that this feed's content was generated. Specified in ET timezone. In some cases this will be set to null when the feed has been created for the first time. This is not intended behaviour and will be corrected when time allows.

teamStatsTotals	
An array of team stats totals entries.

teamStatsTotals.team	
The team's details.

teamStatsTotals.stats	
A list of the team's stats totals for the season. If a list of comma-delimited stats abbreviations has been specified, only those applicable stats will be listed.

The stats listed here are not exhaustive, as suggested by the ellipses (...). In fact, the supported stats can potentially change from season to season. (Although that will mostly only be the case for older seasons)

For a complete list of supported stats for each season, use the Current Season feeed.
