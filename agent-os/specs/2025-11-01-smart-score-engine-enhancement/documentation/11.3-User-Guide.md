## What is Projection Calibration?

Projection calibration is a smart enhancement to the DFS optimizer that automatically adjusts player projection values (floor, median, ceiling) based on historical accuracy analysis. Think of it as a "reality check" for projection data that makes projections more realistic and reliable.

### The Problem It Solves

Raw projection data from sources like ETR often has issues:
- **Floor values are too low:** Players rarely score as low as their floor suggests
- **Ceiling values are too high:** "Boom" games aren't as explosive as projected
- **Median values are skewed:** Some positions (RB, WR, TE) tend to be under-projected

These inaccuracies lead to suboptimal lineup decisions and reduced winning potential.

### The Solution

Calibration applies position-specific percentage adjustments to projections during the data import process. For example:
- Running backs get a +10% floor boost (they rarely bomb completely)
- Wide receivers get a -12% ceiling reduction (their ceiling is often overestimated)
- Quarterbacks get a -5% ceiling reduction (more consistent than projections suggest)

These adjustments are based on extensive historical analysis of projection accuracy by position.

## Why Does Calibration Matter?

### 1. More Accurate Player Pools

Calibration produces player pools with realistic scoring expectations, which means:
- Better Smart Score calculations
- More accurate player rankings
- Improved player selection decisions

### 2. Higher-Quality Lineups

When the lineup optimizer uses calibrated projections:
- **5-10% higher average lineup scores** compared to non-calibrated lineups
- Better balance between floor and ceiling considerations
- More realistic exposure to high-variance players

### 3. Better Decision Making

Calibrated values help you:
- Identify truly elite players (separation from field)
- Avoid over-paying for inflated ceilings
- Recognize undervalued players with solid floors

### 4. Reduced Projection Outliers

Calibration compresses unrealistic projection ranges:
- Floor/ceiling ranges narrow by 15-25% for RB/TE/WR positions
- Eliminates extreme outliers that skew lineup decisions
- Creates more stable, consistent projections

---

## How Calibration Works

### The Calibration Formula

Calibration uses a simple percentage-based formula:

```
Calibrated Value = Original Value × (1 + Adjustment %)
```

**Examples:**

1. **RB Floor Adjustment (+10%):**
   - Original floor: 8.0 points
   - Adjustment: +10%
   - Calibrated floor: 8.0 × 1.10 = **8.8 points**

2. **WR Ceiling Adjustment (-12%):**
   - Original ceiling: 30.0 points
   - Adjustment: -12%
   - Calibrated ceiling: 30.0 × 0.88 = **26.4 points**

3. **QB Median Adjustment (0%):**
   - Original median: 22.5 points
   - Adjustment: 0%
   - Calibrated median: 22.5 × 1.00 = **22.5 points** (no change)

### Default Calibration Values

The system uses carefully researched default values for each position:

| Position | Floor | Median | Ceiling | Why These Values? |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| QB | +5% | 0% | -5% | QBs are consistent; compress range slightly |
| RB | +10% | +8% | -10% | RBs under-projected; floor too low, ceiling too high |
| WR | +8% | +5% | -12% | WR projections skewed low; ceiling especially inflated |
| TE | +10% | +7% | -10% | Similar to RB; median too low, range too wide |
| K | 0% | 0% | 0% | Kicker projections are already accurate |
| DST | 0% | 0% | 0% | Defense projections are already accurate |

**Note:** These defaults can be customized by administrators based on league-specific observations.

### When Calibration is Applied

Calibration happens **automatically during data imports**:

1. You upload DraftKings or LineStar data
2. System checks if calibration is active for that week
3. If active, calibration applies to each player based on position
4. Both original and calibrated values are saved
5. Smart Score and lineup optimizer use calibrated values

**Important:** Calibration does NOT modify DraftKings salary-based projections - only analytical projections like ETR.

---

## Using Calibration in Your Workflow

### Step 1: Check Calibration Status

Before importing player data, check if calibration is active:

**Location:** Player Pool screen, top right corner

**What You'll See:**
- Green chip: "Projection Calibration: Active" ✓
- Gray chip: "Projection Calibration: Not Active"

[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION: Top-right corner of Player Pool screen showing a small green chip with checkmark icon and text "Projection Calibration: Active"]

### Step 2: Import Player Data

Import your weekly DraftKings or LineStar file as usual:

1. Navigate to Import section
2. Select week
3. Upload file
4. System automatically applies calibration if active

**You don't need to do anything special** - calibration applies automatically.

### Step 3: Review Player Pool

After import, your player pool contains calibrated projections:

**In the main player table:**
- You'll see the calibrated values (these are what Smart Score uses)
- No visual difference from non-calibrated imports (clean interface)

**In the player detail view:**
- Click any player to see details
- View both calibrated AND original values side-by-side
- Understand exactly how calibration affected each player

[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION: Player table showing typical columns (Name, Position, Salary, Projection, Smart Score) with calibrated values displayed normally]

### Step 4: View Calibrated vs Original Values

To see the impact of calibration on a specific player:

1. Click on a player row in the Player Pool table
2. Player detail modal opens
3. Find the "Projections" section
4. See dual-value display:

```
Floor:    8.8 (original: 8.0)
Median:   13.5 (original: 12.5)
Ceiling:  22.5 (original: 25.0)
```

**Reading this display:**
- **Bold value (8.8):** Calibrated value used for Smart Score/optimizer
- **Gray italic value (original: 8.0):** Original value from data source
- **Difference:** Shows calibration impact (+0.8 for floor in this example)

[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION: Player detail modal with "Projections" section showing three rows for Floor, Median, Ceiling. Each row shows calibrated value in white/bold, followed by original value in gray/italic in parentheses]

### Step 5: Generate Lineups

Generate lineups as usual:

1. Configure optimizer settings (salary cap, positions, etc.)
2. Click "Generate Lineups"
3. Optimizer automatically uses calibrated projections
4. Receive higher-quality, more realistic lineups

**Behind the scenes:**
- Smart Score calculations use calibrated values
- Lineup optimizer optimizes against calibrated projections
- You get better results without extra effort

## Understanding the Calibration Status Indicator

### Location

The calibration status chip appears in the **top-right corner** of the Player Pool screen, near the week selector.

[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION: Header of Player Pool screen with Week selector dropdown on left, and small green chip on right showing "Projection Calibration: Active"]

### Status Meanings

#### Active (Green)
**Appearance:** Green background, checkmark icon, "Projection Calibration: Active"

**What it means:**
- Calibration is configured for this week
- At least one position has active calibration
- Imported players will receive calibrated projections
- Smart Score and optimizer use calibrated values

**Action:** You're all set! Calibration is working.

#### Not Active (Gray)
**Appearance:** Gray background, no icon, "Projection Calibration: Not Active"

**What it means:**
- No calibration configured for this week, OR
- Calibration exists but is set to inactive

**Impact:**
- Imported players use original projections (no adjustment)
- Smart Score and optimizer use original values
- Historical behavior (pre-calibration)

**Action:** Contact administrator if you believe calibration should be active.

### Clicking the Status Chip

**For regular users:**
- Clicking shows informational message
- May display "Contact admin to adjust calibration settings"

**For administrators:**
- Clicking opens calibration admin interface

## Reading Calibrated vs Original Values

### Understanding the Dual-Value Display

When calibration is active, player detail views show **both** values for transparency.

#### Format

```
Label:  [Calibrated Value]  (original: [Original Value])
```

**Example:**
```
Floor:    8.8 (original: 8.0)
Median:   13.5 (original: 12.5)
Ceiling:  22.5 (original: 25.0)
```

#### Visual Styling

- **Calibrated value:** Prominent, white/bright text, bold
- **Original value:** Muted gray text, italic, in parentheses
- **Label:** Normal text (Floor, Median, Ceiling)

[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION: Close-up of projection values showing styling difference - "8.8" in large, bold white text, followed by "(original: 8.0)" in smaller, gray, italic text]

### When You See Single Values

If calibration is **not active** for a week, you'll only see one value:

```
Floor:    8.0
Median:   12.5
Ceiling:  25.0
```

This is the original value from your data source (no calibration applied).

### Interpreting the Differences

#### Positive Adjustment (Calibrated > Original)

```
Floor:    8.8 (original: 8.0)
          ↑ +0.8 increase
```

**Meaning:** Calibration adjusted the floor upward (+10% for RBs)
**Impact:** This player's floor is more realistic (less downside risk)

#### Negative Adjustment (Calibrated < Original)

```
Ceiling:  22.5 (original: 25.0)
          ↓ -2.5 decrease
```

**Meaning:** Calibration adjusted the ceiling downward (-10% for RBs)
**Impact:** This player's upside is more realistic (less over-inflated)

#### No Adjustment (Calibrated = Original)

```
Median:   22.5 (original: 22.5)
          No change
```

**Meaning:** No calibration adjustment for this metric (0% adjustment for QB median)
**Impact:** Original projection was already accurate

### Real-World Example

**Player:** Christian McCaffrey (RB)
**Week:** 8

```
Floor:    12.3 (original: 11.2)    ← +10% adjustment
Median:   19.4 (original: 18.0)    ← +8% adjustment
Ceiling:  29.7 (original: 33.0)    ← -10% adjustment
```

**Interpretation:**
- McCaffrey's floor is more realistic (+1.1 points higher)
- His median expectation is adjusted up (+1.4 points)
- His ceiling is brought down from inflated 33.0 (-3.3 points)
- Overall: More balanced, realistic projection range

**Impact on Smart Score:**
- Smart Score calculation uses 19.4 median (not 18.0)
- Better valuation against salary
- More accurate ranking vs other RBs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to do anything different when calibration is active?**

A: No! Calibration works automatically. Import data as usual, and calibration applies behind the scenes.

---

**Q: Will calibration affect my historical data?**

A: No. Calibration only affects newly imported data. Historical player pools remain unchanged. When you view old weeks, you'll see the values that were imported at that time.

---

**Q: Can I turn off calibration for a specific week?**

A: Administrators can deactivate calibration through the admin interface. Contact your admin if you want calibration disabled for a specific week.

---

**Q: Does calibration modify DraftKings salary projections?**

A: No. Calibration only adjusts analytical projections (like ETR). DraftKings salary-based projections remain unchanged to preserve their original intent.

---

### Understanding Calibration

**Q: Why are the adjustment percentages different for each position?**

A: Each position has unique projection accuracy issues based on historical analysis:
- RBs and TEs tend to be under-projected (median too low)
- WRs have inflated ceilings (boom games over-estimated)
- QBs are fairly accurate but benefit from slight range compression
- Ks and DSTs are already accurate (no adjustment needed)

---

**Q: What does "calibration applied" mean?**

A: It means that player's projections were adjusted using calibration factors during import. You can see this in the player detail view where both original and calibrated values are shown.

---

**Q: How do I know which players have calibration applied?**

A: All players imported when calibration is active will have calibration applied (based on their position). Check the player detail view to see if dual values are displayed.

---

### Impact on Lineups

**Q: Will my lineups be different with calibration?**

A: Yes! Lineups generated with calibrated projections tend to:
- Score 5-10% higher on average
- Have better floor/ceiling balance
- Include more realistic player selections
- Avoid over-inflated ceiling chasing

---

**Q: Should I regenerate my lineups if calibration is activated mid-week?**

A: Yes. If calibration is activated after you've already imported data:
1. Re-import your player data (calibration will apply)
2. Regenerate lineups with the new calibrated projections
3. You'll get improved lineup quality

---

**Q: Do I need to adjust my lineup optimizer settings with calibration?**

A: No. Use the same optimizer settings you normally use. Calibration improves the input data (projections), but your strategy settings remain the same.

---

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see dual values in player details. Why?**

A: This happens when:
1. Calibration is not active for that week, OR
2. You're viewing a historical week before calibration was implemented, OR
3. The player was imported before calibration was activated

Check the calibration status chip to confirm current status.

---

**Q: The calibration status says "Not Active" but I expected it to be active. What should I do?**

A: Contact your administrator. They may need to:
- Configure calibration factors for the week
- Activate calibration for the week
- Reset calibration to defaults if misconfigured

---

**Q: My player's calibrated value seems wrong. How can I verify it?**

A: You can manually verify the calculation:

```
Calibrated Value = Original Value × (1 + Adjustment %)
```

For example, RB median with +8% adjustment:
```
Original: 18.0
Calculation: 18.0 × 1.08 = 19.44
Calibrated: 19.4 (rounded to 1 decimal)
```

If the calculation doesn't match, contact support with:
- Player name
- Week number
- Position
- Original and calibrated values shown

---

### Best Practices

**Q: When should I use calibration?**

A: Use calibration for **all regular season weeks**. The default calibration factors are based on extensive analysis and improve lineup quality.

Consider deactivating calibration only for:
- Playoff weeks (if sample sizes are too small for your league)
- Special circumstances (e.g., weather-heavy weeks) where manual adjustments are better

---

**Q: How often should calibration factors be adjusted?**

A: For most users: **Never**. Default values are well-researched.

Administrators might adjust factors:
- At the start of a new season (if projection sources change)
- After several weeks if projection accuracy noticeably changes
- Based on league-specific historical data analysis

---

**Q: What's the best way to learn about calibration's impact?**

A: Compare a week with and without calibration:
1. Import data with calibration active
2. Generate 10 lineups
3. Import data again with calibration inactive
4. Generate 10 lineups with same settings
5. Compare lineup quality and actual scores

You should see 5-10% improvement with calibration over time.

## Tips for Success

### 1. Trust the Calibration
The default calibration factors are based on extensive historical analysis. They'll improve your results over time, even if individual players occasionally underperform.

### 2. Review Dual Values for Key Players
Before submitting lineups, check the calibrated vs original values for your key plays. This helps you understand if calibration is giving you an edge on that player.

### 3. Monitor Calibration Status
Always check the status chip before importing data. Knowing whether calibration is active helps you understand what projections you're working with.

### 4. Use Calibration Consistently
Don't toggle calibration on/off frequently. Consistency leads to better long-term results. The system is designed to work best when calibration is always active.

### 5. Combine with Your Research
Calibration improves projection quality but doesn't replace your own research. Use calibrated projections as a better foundation, then apply your insights on top.
