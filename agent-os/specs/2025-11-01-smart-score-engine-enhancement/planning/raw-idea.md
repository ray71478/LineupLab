# Raw Idea: Smart Score Engine Enhancement

## Feature Description

Enhance the Smart Score Engine to incorporate projection calibration and advanced analytics. The focus is primarily on backend capabilities that leverage historical projection accuracy data (like ETR projection performance by position) to create better player pools and lineups. Keep UI enhancements minimal - we like the current UI, but consider essential user controls. The system should be empowered with enough analytical information to make optimal decisions about player selection and lineup generation.

## Key Context from User

- Analysis shows ETR projections need calibration (floor/ceiling ranges too wide, median projections skewed for RB/TE/WR)
- Focus should be on backend analytics and data processing
- Goal is to create best possible player pools and lineups using this enhanced intelligence
- Minimal UI changes - preserve current design but add necessary controls
