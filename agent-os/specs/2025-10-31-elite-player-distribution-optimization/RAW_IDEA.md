# Elite Player Distribution Optimization System

## Raw Feature Description

The current lineup optimizer generates lineups one-at-a-time with bonuses to influence elite player selection, but this approach is broken. Elite players don't appear with correct frequency even with 500-point bonuses. The solution is to switch to a portfolio optimization approach that generates all 10 lineups simultaneously with distribution constraints based on Milly Winner research.

## Key Details

**Problem:** Top Smart Score players (like #1 RB Jonathan Taylor) only appear in 2-3 lineups instead of 8-10

**Research Foundation:** 8 weeks of Milly Winner analysis showing specific distribution patterns per position

**Solution:** Portfolio optimization generating all lineups at once with appearance constraints

**Expected Effort:** 8-12 hours across 5 phases
